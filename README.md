# Managing-Noisy-Data-AI-Python

## 🏥 Hospital Data Quality ETL Pipeline

## 📌 Description

### This project implements a clean and modular ETL pipeline to identify and report problematic records in hospital datasets stored as CSV files. It focuses on data quality assurance by detecting:

### - 🧨 Noisy records — rows with missing or non-numeric values in key numerical columns.
### - 🔁 Duplicate records — repeated entries that may distort analysis.
### - 📊 Combined issues — a unified view of all problematic rows for inspection or downstream cleaning.
